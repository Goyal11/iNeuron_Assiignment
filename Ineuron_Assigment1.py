#Q10.
I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
In this , 'I have eaten 'is the String and 99 is an integer and ' burritos. ' is also a String.
We cannot concatinate two different datatypes together that why it is throwing an error.

We can fix this error by typecasting an integer value(99) into a String value and then able to perform concatination Operation.

'I have eaten'+ '99' + 'burritos.'
